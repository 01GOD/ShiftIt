*Managing window size and position in OSX*

Overview
--------

ShiftIt is an application for OSX that allows you to quickly manipulate window position and size using keyboard shortcuts. It intends to become a full featured window organizer for OSX.
It is a fork from the original [ShiftIt][1] by [Aravindkumar Rajendiran][2] which is not longer under development.

Related Work
------------

ShiftIt is far not the only application that is trying to somehow organize windows. If you are looking for some commercial solution than you can check [SizeUp][9] (which seemed to be the inspiration for the original Rajendiran's ShiftIt). Plenty of others can be found at [alternative.to][10].
