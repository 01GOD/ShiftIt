ShiftIt (Managing windows size and position in OSX)
=======

Overview
--------

ShiftIt is an application for OSX that allows you to quickly manipulate window's position and size using a predefined ket keys.

This is a fork from the original [ShiftIt][1] by [Aravindkumar Rajendiran][2] which is not longer under development.

The idea is to add just a few features that are currently missing like keyboard configuration, menu icon, etc., make it a solid production ready app.

Actually menu icon is done - thanks to free icons available at [mysitemyway][4]

Related Work
------------

There is a feature full comertial application called [SizeUp][5] that I guess was an inspiration for the original ShitIt. If you are looking for a ready application with lot of features, [SizeUp][6] is way to go.
